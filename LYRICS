We're no strangers to hate
You copied my rules, and I don't

A pull request's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other license

I just wanna tell you to be original

Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you hope
Never gonna let you survive
Never gonna collab to repositories using you
Never gonna make you die
But I will say goodbye

We've known each other, for so long.
Your heart's been aching, even though you don't have one

Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the license and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
It's pretty bad can't you see

Never gonna give you hope
Never gonna let you survive
Never gonna collab to repositories using you
Never gonna make you die
But I will say goodbye

Never gonna give you hope
Never gonna let you survive
Never gonna collab to repositories using you
Never gonna make you die
But I will say goodbye
